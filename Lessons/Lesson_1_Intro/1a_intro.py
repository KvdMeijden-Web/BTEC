# Sentences with # at the start are comments. The interpreter ignores them. 
# To put a # for a line is called "hashing out" the line.
# A quick way to hash out a line is to select the line and press Ctrl + / (or Cmd + / on Mac).

# ------------------------------------
# Task 1: write two lines of comments!

# ------------------------------------
# Task 1: Run your first code! let it print "Hello World" to the terminal.
# print("text to print")

print("Hello world!"
